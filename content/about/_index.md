## DevOps and web application

- **Yaml, Markdown, html, css and javascripts through Hugo, Discourse and Ghost**

> As a Founder of two non-profit projects [GCDFL](https://gcdfl.org/),introducing the Eastern Churches into Chinese audience by academic lectures and [CTCFOL](https://ctcfol.org/), Chinese Translation of Church Fathers from Original Language. I learned to build these two websites through Hugo. I also made a [docs for CTCFOL](https://doc.ctcfol.org/) through [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is simple and easy to use for a static websites. I learned Yaml, Markdown, and a little bit about html, css and javascripts through building these three websites. 

> I also build a [Forum](https://forum.ctcfol.org) to teaching ancient Greek and Syriac through [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/).

> I build a personal websites [ephremyuan](https://ephremyuan.com) for sharing my translations through [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). 

- **Reverse Proxy Servives, [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)**

> About reverse proxy service, I initially used [NGINX proxy manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/), now I use Caddy. The latter's characteristic is to automatically add the certificate ssl to the domain name, setup is simple, more convenient.

- **Git, Github and Backup tools**
For a remote backup: I applied for Yandex-1tb plan, and use rclone + restic to achieve regular backup.
I use git and github to backup the following three websites, GCDFL, CTCFOL, and docs for CTCFOL. 

- **Working flowing: Terminal and Editor**
> I love terminal, I have used [warp](https://www.warp.dev/), [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/), alacritty, now I use kitty. 

> For the editors: I now use [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)+[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)as my IDE. About simple Neovim IDE, I recommend [Nvchad](https://nvchad.com/) and [Lunarvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/).
